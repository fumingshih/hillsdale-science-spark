1. Invisible Ink
Set Up: 
Cut water color postcards into 4ths. Mix 1tbsp of turmeric with a quarter cup of rubbing alcohol. Mix a tbsp of baking soda with a quarter cup of water. 
*Make sure the experiment is done on a tray. Bring gloves if you want to avoid staining your hands or just avoid getting turmeric mixture on your hands.

Hook: 
Ask the kids if they like spies or ninjas, then elaborate and ask if they want to send a secret message.

Procedure: 
Using a thin brush dip into the baking soda solution draining excess liquid on the side of the cup. Then write on the paper, whatever they want (it could be their name, a star, a heart, a smiley face, etc.). 
After writing, have the kids pick up the paper and fan it to dry it off. Do this for about 20 sec, the paper does not have to be completely dry. 
Then using a big brush dip into the turmeric mixture and drain excess liquid on the side of the cup. Have the kids do a quick pass covering the whole paper until it's covered in the turmeric mixture. (It does not need to be perfect, it just needs to cover their initial drawing). *Do not let the kids use a small brush and paint the paper in the turmeric mixture, it takes a long time, and runs the risk of them staining their hands. 
After about 5 sec their initial drawing will start to show up with it being more clear to see after 20 sec. 
Explanation:
(For kids) It's like a game of hide and seek, the baking soda mixture disappears and hides and when the turmeric mixture is brushed over the turmeric acts as the seeker and when it finds the baking soda it changes color to say “It’s Here”.
(For Older Kids/Adults) It's a ph based reaction. The baking soda is a base mixture and when the alkaline turmeric mixture passes over it changes color due to turmeric being a natural ph indicator. 
Where you see it in life - While sending secret messages is not as common anymore, ph based reactions are used in many ways. For example, in the medical field there are sutures that change color when the ph in your body changes. After surgery, if you have an infection the ph in your body changes which makes the suture change color which lets you know to go back and see a doctor. This is really useful for impoverished communities who don’t have access to high end medical technology that can detect problems faster.


2. Pellet Dissection 

Setup:
Place one owl pellet in each tray placing tweezers and toothpicks beside it. Prep the storage containers by placing cotton balls in each one. 
Procedure:
Have each kid break down the owl pellet and search for bones. When they find a bone, have them try to identify what animal it may come from and what part of the animal it comes from. As they find bones, have them place them in the storage container to take home. When done give the kids a piece of tape to tape the container shut, also have them write their name on it so they know its theirs.
Explanation:
Owls don’t have teeth so they swallow their prey whole but their stomachs can’t break down bones and fur so they regurgitate the bones and fur in the form of a owl pellet. 
*Kids may try to find every bone in the pellet but we want to use one pellet for multiple children so try to encourage them to spend their time on things like identifying the bones. It tends to work when trying to make them lose interest.
*Skulls are considered the best bone a kid can get but there is usually one only skull per pellet
*If kids can’t find any more bones, feel free to find some for them. They tend to be small and harder to find when the pellet has been searched multiple times already.


3. Science of Sound
Set Up: 
Different metal objects (ie. hanger, whisk, etc) with strings attached to them, try to detangle strings and spread out the different objects

Procedure: 
Have the kids pick up which tool they want to use. 
Instruct them to wrap the string around their finger about 3 times. (If they need help, have them stick their pointer finger up and help them wrap it). Make sure both fingers are wrapped around different strands of the string.
Then have the kids plug their ears just like they would when there is a loud sound. 
Afterwards instruct the kids to swing the object and hit the table. They should be able to hear a sound. (If the kid is too short as them if they want help hitting the table and then help them)
Afterwards you can let them continue to do it or try another object, or they can go to a different activity

Alternate Activity:
Have the kids put their ear on the table and then knock on it. Same explanation

Explanation:
Sound moves in waves and usually sound travels through the air before it reaches their ears, but in this case the sound travels from the object through the string differently into their ears at a faster rate so they are hearing the sound differently then they normally would. Just like when we speak we think we sound a certain way but the sound waves we make get to our ears quicker then they do to others so we actually sound different to others then we think.


4. Foil Boat Float
Set Up
Fill the plastic container halfway with water. Rip out uniform sheets of foil.

Procedure
Give each child a sheet of foil. Ask them to shape it into a boat or tray that can hold weight. Place the foil boat gently on the water. Have the kids slowly add washer weights to the boat, one at a time. Ask the kids to observe how many objects the boat can hold before it sinks.

Explanation:

Some boats float because their shape spreads the weight out and the foil is light.
Boats sink if they are too heavy or if the shape lets water in. This experiment helps us understand buoyancy — how objects float in water. Scientists make predictions, test them, and learn from what happens.

5. Sink or Float
Set Up
Fill two plastic containers halfway with water. Leave the third empty to place the objects into after doing one round of the activity.
Procedure:
Show the kids one object and ask: “Do you think this will sink or float?” Place the object in the water and observe what happens. Sort objects into “sink” and “float” piles.Repeat with each item until all objects are tested.


Explanation
 Some objects float because they are light for their size and can rest on top of the water (like a sponge or plastic toy). Other objects sink because they are heavier and denser than the water (like a rock or coin). Scientists make predictions, test them, and learn from what happens — and this experiment helps us do the same!
6. Balloon Rocket
Set Up:
Tie one long piece of string (6–10 feet) between two chairs or tables so it’s pulled tight.
Place one straw on the string before tying the second end.
Prepare balloons (round or long), pieces of tape, and markers if kids want to decorate their “rocket.”
Make sure the experiment is done in an open space or hallway so the balloon has room to travel. Bring extra balloons in case some pop.

Hook:
Ask the kids: “Have you ever wanted to launch your own rocket?”
Follow up with: “What if you could build a rocket that blasts off using air instead of fire?”

Procedure:
Have the kids pick a balloon and decorate it if they want.
Hold the balloon (do not tie it) and inflate it. Pinch the end closed with their fingers.
Place the straw on top of the balloon and tape the balloon securely to the straw.
Make sure the balloon opening is pointed toward the starting side of the string.
When ready, have the kids let go of the balloon and watch it shoot across the string!
Let them try again—testing different balloon sizes, more or less air, or different string angles.

Explanation:

(For Kids)
It’s like the balloon is full of “zoom power.” When you let it go, all the air rushes out the back, and that pushes the balloon forward on the string like a little rocket!

(For Older Kids/Adults)
The balloon rocket works because of Newton’s Third Law of Motion:
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Air rushing out the back of the balloon is the action, and the balloon moving forward is the reaction.
The straw keeps the balloon moving in a straight line by guiding it along the string.

Real rockets work the same way—hot gases shoot downward and the rocket is pushed upward.




7. Reaction Time Lab
Topic: Measuring Human Reaction Time
Materials:
2–3 rulers


Reaction time chart/table printed out


Instructions:
Hold the ruler vertically at the 0 cm mark, with the 30 cm end hanging down.


The kids place their thumb and index finger just above the bottom of the ruler (not touching it).


Drop the ruler without warning.


The catcher grabs it as quickly as possible.


Record the measurement (in cm) where their fingers caught the ruler.


Do at least 3 trials per person.


Using their best time, use the reaction time chart to find their reaction time.


Explanation:
 When the ruler is dropped, your eyes see it, but it takes time for your nervous system to send that information to your brain. Then your brain processes it and sends a “Grab it!” signal to your hand. The muscles contract, and you catch the ruler. The total delay is called reaction time, and it can improve with practice!

8. Yuck or Yum

Cilantro Tasting Lab

Set Up:

Give each kid a small piece of cilantro

Procedure:

Ask each student to look at the cilantro and smell it. What do they notice? Ask them to take a small bite and chew slowly. Have them describe the taste using words like soapy, fresh, citrusy, or bitter.


Explanation:

People taste cilantro differently because of a gene called OR6A2, which makes some people extra sensitive to certain aldehyde molecules in cilantro.

These aldehydes are naturally present in cilantro and smell similar to soap or detergents to people with this gene.

People without this sensitivity perceive cilantro as fresh, citrusy, or slightly peppery.

This lab shows that genetics can influence taste perception, and why scientists study variation in human senses.

9. My Senses
Ask the Kids:
What are some flavors of Skittles you know?
Do you think you can guess the flavor without smelling it?
If there are multiple kids, have them compete!
Instructions 1:
Close your eyes and don’t look at the color of the Skittle I give you. We want you to focus on taste, not sight!
 Pinch your nose shut and keep it pinched while you chew. This will prevent you from smelling the Skittle as you taste it.
Put the Skittle in your mouth and start chewing while still holding your nose.
Try to guess the flavor while you’re chewing. How does it taste without smelling it?
Now, release your nose and continue chewing. Can you guess the flavor now?
Questions:
Did the flavor change when you released your nose?
What did you notice about how smell affects taste?
Have you ever had a stuffy nose before? How did that affect your sense of taste?
Explanation: Flavor is actually influenced by your sense of smell, not just your taste buds!
Instructions 2:

Hold up American Flag paper
Stare at the dot for two minutes, keep your eyes on the dot!
After time’s up, immediately look at a blank piece of white paper. 
Do you see an American Flag?

Questions:

Were you able to see the American flag on the white paper?
What colors did you notice? Did anything change?
How do you think your brain created that image?

Explanation: 
In our eyes, we have receptors that let us see different colors of light. They send signals to our brain telling us what colors to see! When you stare at the inverted American flag for a long time, the receptors for the colors you are looking at get tired out. For instance, the blue light receptors that are detecting the blue stripes get tired out.
When you look at a white piece of paper, you’re actually looking at all the colors of light mixed together. But because your blue receptors are tired out, you only see the red light. Your brain fills in the opposite color! That’s why when you look at the white paper, you see the red stripes of the American flag!





10. Make Your Own Telephone
Prepare Cups:
Make them use the pencil to poke a small hole in the bottom center of each cup.
Have them push one end of the string through the hole in each cup (help if needed)
Tie each end to a paperclip (this keeps the string from slipping through)
Test the Telephone:
The student takes the cup and walks away until the string is tight.
Talk into their cup while they listen
Ask them to press on the string and listen while you talk (they shouldn’t hear anything)
Switch roles.

Explanation
The string telephone helps people communicate over distances with sound. When one person talks into the cup, the sound from their voice vibrates down the string. The partner can then hear the message loud and clear in their cup. 

When your finger touches the string, it absorbs some of the energy instead of letting it move freely to the other cup. If the string is loose or your finger presses hard, the vibrations can’t reach the other cup, so the listener hears little or nothing.

12. Wacky Water Lab
Part 1: Exploring Water Tension
Place a penny on a flat surface.
Fill a dropper with water.
Carefully drop water onto the penny, one drop at a time.
Count how many drops the penny can hold until the surface tension breaks and the water spills off the sides.
Make it a competition! Ask each person if they can beat the record for the most drops.
Discussion Questions:
Guess how many drops you think will fit on the penny.
Did the actual number of drops match your prediction?
Why do you think so many drops fit on the penny? (Explain the concept of surface tension: water molecules like to stick together, kind of like friends holding hands, and this makes the surface strong enough to hold drops together on the penny without spilling. )
Part 2: Hydrophobic vs. Hydrophilic Surfaces
Place a drop of water on a piece of wax paper.
Place another drop of water on a glass slide.
Race with a partner: Use a toothpick to pull the water droplet, racing it from one end to the other on each surface.
Discussion Questions:
Predict which surface will allow the water droplet to travel faster: wax paper or the glass slide?
What did you observe?
Explain: Wax paper is hydrophobic, meaning it repels water, while the glass slide is hydrophilic, meaning it attracts water.

13. Strong Structures
Place two books a few inches apart to create a gap for the bridge.
Take one sheet of paper and fold it in half. Place it between the two books to create a simple bridge.
Carefully start placing pennies on the center of the paper bridge, one at a time. Count how many pennies the bridge can hold before it collapses.
Try different folding techniques (like accordion folds or multiple folds) and place the paper bridge back between the books.
Count how many pennies each new folding style can hold.
Let the kids experiment with different folding methods to see how they can make the bridge stronger.
Keep track of the highest record of pennies to motivate the kids to make better bridges
Questions:
Reflect: What differences did you notice between the first bridge and the other bridges you made?
Predict: How many pennies do you think this next bridge will hold?
Design: What kind of folding do you think will make the strongest bridge? Why?

14. Magic Drawing  

Experiment: Refraction of Light – Seeing How looking at drawings through glass cup with water affects drawings
Materials:
A clear glass filled with water
Small pieces of paper for kids to draw on
Pens or markers
Step 1: Demonstration
Start by drawing two arrows on a piece of paper, both pointing in the same direction (→ →).
Hold the drawing behind a glass of water.
Ask the kids to look at one or both arrows through the water.
Questions to ask:
"Which way are the arrows pointing now?"
"Does it change if we move the glass closer or farther?"
"What happens when you move your head side to side?"
Step 2: Let the Kids Draw
Give each kid a small piece of paper and a pen.
Have them draw whatever they like (e.g., smiley faces, shapes, or arrows pointing in different directions).
Let them experiment by looking at their drawings through the glass of water and noticing what changes!
What’s Happening?
When light passes through the glass of water, it bends (refracts). This bending changes the way we see the objects behind the glass, sometimes even flipping the direction of arrows or making smiley faces appear different!
Fingerprints and Forensics Activity Instructions
Objective: Learn how to collect fingerprints and compare them to identify patterns, just like a real forensic scientist!
Materials:
Pencils


Clear tape


15.Fingerprint printouts (examples of loops, whorls, arches)


Magnifying glasses



Step 1: Collect your fingerprint
Roll the tip of your finger lightly on the pencil lead so it picks up some graphite.


Press your finger firmly and gently onto a piece of clear tape.


Carefully stick the tape onto a blank spot on the activity sheet.



Step 2: Examine your fingerprint
Use the magnifying glass to look closely at the lines and patterns on your print.


Compare your fingerprint to the printed examples of loops, whorls, and arches.


Try to identify which pattern your fingerprint matches.




Help kids roll their fingers without smudging.


Encourage kids to look closely through magnifying glasses.


Ask questions like:


“What shapes do you notice?”


“Does your print match a loop, whorl, or arch?”


Make it fun! Kids love pretending to be detectives.


16. Static Electricity Butterfly Activity Instructions
Objective: Explore how static electricity can make objects move without touching them, just like a magician!
Materials:
Tissue paper or lightweight paper butterflies (pre-cut)


Balloons


Tape or string (to anchor butterflies, optional)



Step 1: Prepare your butterfly
Place your paper butterfly on a flat surface (table or tray).


Make sure it can move freely and isn’t taped down completely — it needs to lift or flutter!



Step 2: Charge your balloon
Rub the balloon vigorously on your hair, sweater, or a piece of cloth for 10–15 seconds.


Explain that this creates static electricity, which makes the balloon carry tiny electric charges.



Step 3: Make the butterfly move
Slowly bring the charged balloon close to the butterfly without touching it.


Watch the wings lift, move, or even “dance” toward the balloon!


Try moving the balloon around — side to side, up and down — to see how the butterfly reacts.



Step 4: Experiment!
What happens if you rub the balloon less? More?


Does the butterfly move differently with a bigger balloon or smaller one?


Can you make the butterfly jump from one place to another using only the balloon?



Tips for Volunteers
Help kids rub the balloon safely — no too-fast movements or rubbing on hair too hard.


Encourage observation: “What do you notice about how it moves?”


Ask kids to predict what will happen before they bring the balloon close.


Let them try multiple times — every attempt is a little experiment!

17. Static Electricity with PVC Pipe and Confetti

Objective: Explore static electricity by making confetti jump and move using a PVC pipe!

Materials:

PVC pipes (1–2 per table)

Small pieces of confetti or tissue paper

Balloons (optional, for extra static)

Step 1: Set up your experiment

Sprinkle a small pile of confetti on the table.

Make sure the confetti is lightweight — tiny pieces work best!

Step 2: Charge your PVC pipe

Rub the PVC pipe on your hair, sweater, or a piece of cloth for 10–15 seconds.

Explain: this transfers tiny electric charges to the pipe, creating static electricity.

Step 3: Make the confetti move

Slowly bring the charged PVC pipe close to the confetti without touching it.

Watch the confetti jump, dance, or stick to the pipe!

Move the pipe around — see how the confetti reacts differently from side to side.

Step 4: Experiment

Try rubbing the pipe more or less — what happens?

Can you move the confetti from one pile to another using just the pipe?

Try different sizes of confetti — does it change how it moves?

Tips for Volunteers

Encourage kids to predict what will happen before moving the pipe.

Make sure kids don’t touch the confetti with the pipe — it works best from a small distance.

Ask: “What do you notice about how the confetti reacts?”

Let them try multiple times — each trial is an experiment!


18. Ocean Acidification Lab: Breathing Into BTB

Objective: Observe how carbon dioxide from your breath can make water acidic, just like what happens in the oceans.

Materials:

BTB (bromothymol blue) solution

Straws

Beakers

Optional: pictures or small models of sea stars, clams, or other shelled animals

Pre-Activity Questions to Consider

Do you know what gas is released when you burn fossil fuels like gasoline or coal?

Do you know what gas is released when you burn food?

(Answer key: CO2 for both)

Instructions

Jog or jump in place for 30 seconds to get your heart rate up.

When you’re breathing hard, insert the straw into the blue liquid and blow gently, making bubbles in the solution.

Important: Blow out only, do not suck in.

Try not to spill any liquid.

Observe what happens to the color of the liquid.

Note for Volunteers:

Kids may accidentally swallow a tiny bit of BTB. It’s relatively non-toxic, so it’s not dangerous, but keep a one-to-one ratio of high school volunteers to participants to supervise safely.

What’s Happening

When CO2 combines with water, it forms carbonic acid:
H2O + CO2 → H2CO3

The BTB solution is a pH indicator that shows acidity:

Yellow = acidic

Green = neutral

Blue = basic

Blowing CO2 into the water makes it slightly acidic, so you may see the color change toward green or yellow.

Why Should We Care?

In 2024, humans released about 41 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. The oceans absorb roughly 1/4 of this (~10 billion tons).

Think about what you saw when you blew into the straw. That same CO2 makes oceans more acidic.

Why does this matter? Many ocean creatures have shells made of calcium carbonate:

Examples: clams, oysters, scallops, shrimp, lobster, crabs, coral, sea urchins, sea stars

Acidic oceans make it harder or impossible for them to form their shells. Without shells, they cannot survive.
