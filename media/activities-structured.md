- Rubbing alcohol
- Baking soda (1 tbsp per 1/4 cup water)
- Water
- Thin paintbrushes for writing
- Big paintbrushes for revealing
- Trays or plates
- Gloves (optional, to avoid staining hands)

### Steps
1. **Setup (5 min):** Cut postcards into quarters. Mix 1 tbsp turmeric with 1/4 cup rubbing alcohol. Mix 1 tbsp baking soda with 1/4 cup water. Set up on trays.
2. **Hook (2 min):** Ask kids if they like spies or ninjas, then ask if they want to send a secret message!
3. **Writing (8 min):** Using thin brush, dip into baking soda solution, draining excess on cup side. Write or draw on paper (name, star, heart, smiley face, etc.).
4. **Drying (20 sec):** Have kids pick up paper and fan it to dry. Doesn't need to be completely dry.
5. **Revealing (10 min):** Using big brush, dip into turmeric mixture, drain excess. Do a quick pass covering whole paper. Message appears after 5 seconds, clearer after 20 seconds!
6. **Explanation:** Discuss pH reaction and real-world uses like medical sutures that change color to detect infections.

4. **Experiment (7 min):** What happens if you rub balloon less? More? Different sized balloons? Can you make butterfly jump?

### Safety Tips
- Help kids rub balloon safely - no too-fast movements
- Don't rub hair too hard
- Keep balloons away from faces
- Watch for balloon allergies

### Engagement Tips
- Encourage observation: "What do you notice about how it moves?"
- Ask kids to predict before bringing balloon close
- Let them try multiple times - every attempt is an experiment!
- Connect to lightning (nature's static electricity)
- Try with other lightweight objects
- Explain: balloon steals electrons, becomes negatively charged

### Questions to Ask
- What makes the butterfly move?
- Why doesn't it work if you don't rub the balloon?
- What happens when the balloon gets closer?
- Where else do you see static electricity?

## Activity 15: Static Electricity with PVC Pipe

**Category:** Physics
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Age Range:** K-6
**Duration:** 25 minutes
**Icon:** ⚡

### Short Description
Explore static electricity by making confetti jump and move using a PVC pipe!

### Full Description
Students create static electricity by rubbing PVC pipes and use them to make confetti jump, dance, and move without touching. This dramatic demonstration shows electrical forces at work.

### Why It's Cool
Confetti jumping through the air looks amazing! Kids love the power they have to control confetti without touching it. The visual effect is dramatic and the science is clear.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand static electricity and charge transfer
- Learn how charged objects attract neutral objects
- Observe forces acting at a distance
- Practice scientific experimentation

### Materials
- PVC pipes (1-2 per table)
- Small pieces of confetti or tissue paper
- Optional: balloons for extra static

### Steps
1. **Setup (3 min):** Sprinkle small pile of confetti on table. Make sure confetti is lightweight.
2. **Charge PVC pipe (5 min):** Rub pipe on hair, sweater, or cloth for 10-15 seconds. Explain: this transfers electric charges to pipe.
3. **Make confetti move (12 min):** Slowly bring charged pipe close to confetti without touching. Watch it jump, dance, and stick to pipe! Move pipe around.
4. **Experiment (5 min):** Try rubbing more or less - what happens? Can you move confetti from one pile to another? Different confetti sizes?

### Safety Tips
- Don't touch confetti with pipe - works best from small distance
- Supervise pipe handling
- Keep confetti away from faces
- Clean up scattered confetti

### Engagement Tips
- Encourage prediction before moving pipe
- Ask: "What do you notice about how the confetti reacts?"
- Let them try multiple times - each trial is an experiment
- Make it competitive - who can pick up most confetti?
- Connect to how dust sticks to TV screens
- Try with other materials (paper scraps, puffed rice)

### Questions to Ask
- Why does the confetti jump toward the pipe?
- What happens if you don't rub the pipe?
- How far away can the pipe be and still work?
- Where else do you see static electricity?

## Activity 16: Ocean Acidification Lab

**Category:** Environmental Science
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Age Range:** 3-6
**Duration:** 30 minutes
**Icon:** 🌊

### Short Description
Observe how carbon dioxide from your breath can make water acidic, just like what happens in the oceans!

### Full Description
Students blow CO2 from their breath into BTB indicator solution and watch it change color, demonstrating how carbon dioxide makes water acidic. This connects to ocean acidification and its impact on marine life with shells.

### Why It's Cool
Seeing your breath change the water color is amazing! The connection to real ocean acidification makes it meaningful. Students realize their actions relate to global environmental issues.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand that CO2 makes water acidic
- Learn about pH indicators
- Discover how ocean acidification affects marine life
- Connect personal actions to environmental impact

### Materials
- BTB (bromothymol blue) solution
- Straws
- Beakers or clear cups
- Optional: pictures of sea stars, clams, shelled animals

### Steps
1. **Pre-questions (3 min):** "What gas is released when you burn fossil fuels? When you burn food?" (Answer: CO2 for both)
2. **Exercise (2 min):** Jog or jump in place for 30 seconds to get heart rate up.
3. **Experiment (15 min):** When breathing hard, insert straw into blue liquid and blow gently, making bubbles. IMPORTANT: Blow out only, don't suck in. Observe color change.
4. **Explanation (10 min):** Discuss: CO2 + water = carbonic acid. BTB is pH indicator: Yellow=acidic, Green=neutral, Blue=basic.

### Safety Tips
- Kids may accidentally swallow tiny bit of BTB - relatively non-toxic but supervise closely
- Keep 1:1 ratio of volunteers to participants
- Blow out only, don't suck in
- Try not to spill liquid

### Engagement Tips
- Connect to environmental impact: "In 2024, humans released 41 billion tons of CO2. Oceans absorb 1/4 of this."
- Show pictures of shelled animals: clams, oysters, coral, sea urchins
- Explain: acidic oceans make it harder for them to form shells
- Discuss: "Think about what you saw when you blew in the straw. That same CO2 makes oceans more acidic."
- Connect to climate change and carbon footprint

### Questions to Ask
- What happened to the water color?
- Why did blowing in the straw change the color?
- What animals could be affected by ocean acidification?
- What can we do to reduce CO2 emissions?
